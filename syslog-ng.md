Building a centralized logging pipeline from scratch with limited internet — and loving every second of it.
What I've got running so far:
✅ Rocky Linux 8 minimal install as a syslog-ng server
✅ Receiving logs from RHEL clients on port 514
✅ Forwarding everything to a Splunk Indexer Cluster
✅ Cluster Manager configured with indexer discovery
Troubleshooting broken repos, missing packages and working around a minimal ISO install has honestly taught me more than any tutorial ever could.
The grind is real but so is the growth. 💪
